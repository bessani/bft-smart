BFT-SMaRt provides a middleware to replicate request from multiple clients to multiple servers. In order to use it, first, BFT-SMaRt has to be downloaded and installed.

==Installation==
First, go to the Downloads section and download the latest stable version of BFT-SMaRt. After that, 

==Client code==

Clients can send messages to replicas using the class {{{bftsmart.tom.ServiceProxy}}}. To send ordered messages to the replicas the {{{invokeOrdered()}}} method must be called. To send messages that don't need to be ordered, the method to be called is {{{invokeUnordered()}}}.
A third option to send messages is {{{invokeAsynchronous()}}}. This last method permits specify for which servers the message has to be send. It also permits implement a custom processing of the server replies through the interface {{{bftsmart.communication.client.ReplyListener}}}.

==Server code==

To process the requests on the server side, the application must implement the interfaces suitable to the business needs and use {{{bftsmart.tom.ServiceReplica}}} class to receive the requests.
The interfaces to be implemented allows the processing of ordered and unordered requests, transfer and store state, process batch of requests batches and forward replies to clients.
The interfaces to be implemented are in the package {{{bftsmart.tom.server}}}. The package {{{bftsmart.tom.server.defaultservices}}} contains default implementations for state management.
